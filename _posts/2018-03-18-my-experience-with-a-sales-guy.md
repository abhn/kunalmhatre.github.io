description: The best sales guy I have ever met.
---

14th March. It was Wednesday. I was returning home from work. I took a train, and it was just like another day - I was reading a book on my phone. After the train started its journey, I got interrupted by a random guy who was standing right next to me asking about my smartphone. He liked the design of my smartphone and wanted to know more about the company that made it. Being a nerd, I started telling him about the phone. After ending up with talking about the phone, he asked me if I work at some company. He asked me about the timings, the work culture and told me that people like me work hard. I started asking about his work then. He said that he takes guitar classes by meeting candidates at their place. Then we started sharing favorite guitar artists, favorite books and coincidently the interests started matching. He wanted to be a businessman or an investor. Honestly, that guy had brilliant communications skills. I felt like I was talking with some other friend of mine. Since he was into teaching guitar, I asked if he had a card of his business. He didn't have it, so we exchanged phone numbers. After reaching the destination, we shook hands and got separated. 

That guy's self-confidence, positive attitude towards Life goals, communication skills just made me crazy. After leaving the train, I dropped a text message letting him know that I liked the conversation and would be open to meet again. I gave him my email address and wished him good luck.

16th March. It was Friday. After returning home from work, he called me and asked how I was doing. Suddenly, he then started asking me what do I do for investments. He also asked if I am interested in having a second income and if yes, would I be interested in participating in the business he is doing. 

Did you see what just happened there? I got owned by a great sales guy. Afterward, things started to make sense to me - as for why he had great communication skills. He told me the set of businesses he was involved in and asked me if he can meet me to talk about it. Honestly, I didn't want to get into a business that he mentioned. Just because I knew about it already, I had an overview of the way it works. It was more for charismatic people, people who got excellent communications and selling skills. I lack all of them. The reason I accepted to meet him again was the initial impression that he left that day. 

17th March. It was Saturday. Before the meeting, I made it clear to myself that I didn't want to participate, but I wanted to see him how he pitches. I was more interested in observing him selling products to me. I also decided to buy a Coffee for him. Later, I went to the Cafe where we decided to meet. He arrived and was dressed up like any other sales guy - formals with an executive satchel. We entered the Cafe and took the table in the corner. The cafe was noisy, groups of people of my age were having conversations - music was on. 

He then took a book, turned some pages and started with a fresh one. I saw some diagrams drawn on the previous pages. I think he uses the same book to explain the business to people who are interested in it. 

He started, and I enjoyed it the way he explained everything from the basics. This time the communication skills were skyrocketing, the attitude, the confidence, everything was rocking. Another thing I liked about him was, he didn't even hesitate to show me cosmetic products that he had with him in his satchel. He didn't care where he was, why the cafes are for, all he had the aim of selling. He didn't think for a while what people would think of him. That's the attitude you need when you want to sell something. He was great. Since I didn't want to participate in his business, I decided to buy a product from him - just for his hard efforts and partially because I was in need of it. 

After finishing the presentation, it was Coffee time. I bought a tea for him and Coffee for myself. We then started talking about our favorite books, interests and more about how he got involved in such business. He said he was also involved in web development business and also writing a book on his personal experiences.

I asked him casually, *"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"*.

He sipped his tea and said, *"I am thinking really big"*. 

After finishing tea and coffee, we left the Cafe. We shook hands for one last time and took our paths. I must say, with such an excellent set of skills he was not any ordinary sales guy, but rather an extraordinary, ambitious and a passionate sales guy. 

To be frank, the best sales guy I have ever met.
