Fussroll is an Android application for sharing our daily status with our friends and family. I developed it when I was in 4th year of my engineering course. The motivation behind making such app, which lets you pick and share statuses, is to make sharing statuses quickly. 

The official tagline goes like this:

> Fussroll lets you quickly share your daily activities with your friends and family.

## Short Story and Tech Involved

I remember it was exams time when I coded the backend for Fussroll. It was fun and a kind of stress buster. Also, it was my first time dealing with integrating OTP mechanism into registration. I used [MSG91](https://msg91.com/) as my SMS gateway - a very good service. While writing notification module, [FCM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/) saved my ass. And then there was [EmojiOne](https://www.emojione.com/), oh my goodness, these people rock at creating emojis. 

I do not remember more details regarding Fussroll as I developed it in early 2017, the reason for putting the article now is just to connect the project to my blog. Feel free to play with it.
