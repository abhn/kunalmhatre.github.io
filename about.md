<p>
I am Kunal Mhatre, I live in India and I am a software developer. I love to program, pentest and hack around things. This blog represents non-personal stories about my Life, my personal views on protecting online privacy and sometimes details about my lousy projects.

## My story in short

[One of my friends](https://www.nagekar.com/) introduced me to web application hacking when I was 16, he performed SQLi on an insecure website and logged in the admin panel. I went crazy just like Archimedesâ€™ Eureka moment. Later I figured out that to enhance hacking skills one has to know how the entire system works, and then I took interest in programming. I learned Java in my 11th grade from this [website](http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/java/java.html) and I used it to solve some of my boring math problems. Believe me, it was fun and yet another Eureka moment in my Life - *we can make computers do anything*. I felt like Superman. Since then I am involved in programming.

## Involvement in tech

<p>
I worked on too many things and I know that is a bad sign of being a jack of all trades. I was into web development for a while where I gained interest in frontend and backend development. I made REST APIs using Node.js and used Bootstrap and <a href="https://getmdl.io">MDL</a> to create beautiful UIs. I made a couple of Android applications too, where I learned the importance of UX while building UIs and I also made my hands dirty in writing bash and Python scripts. <i>Currently, taking over JavaScript.</i>

## Life AFK (away from keyboard)

<p>
I like visiting seashore in the evenings. I love spending time in the nature and I also like to stare at the night sky, looking for stars. Sounds dramatic, but true.

## Books that I recommend

- **How to Win Friends and Influence People** by *Dale Carnegie* -- A pure gem. If you find difficult to deal with people, make this your first choice. 
- **The Power of your Subconscious Mind** *by Joseph Murphy* -- A book which teaches you on how you can make best out of your subconscious mind. It's truly great.
- **Zero to One** *by Peter Thiel and Blake Masters* -- This book contains quality notes on how to build a successful startup. Do read it if you like startup culture.
