<p>
I am Kunal Mhatre, I live in India and I am a software developer. I love to program, pentest and hack around things. This blog represents stories about my Life, my personal views on protecting online privacy and sometimes details about my lousy projects.
</p>

## My story in short

One of my friends introduced me to web application hacking when I was 16, he performed SQLi on an insecure website and logged in the admin panel. I went crazy just like Archimedesâ€™ Eureka moment. Later I figured out that to enhance hacking skills one has to know how the entire system works, and then I took interest in programming. I learned Java in my 11th grade from this [website](http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/java/java.html) and I used it to solve some of my boring math problems. Believe me, it was fun and yet another Eureka moment in my Life - *we can make computers do anything*. I felt like Superman. Since then I am involved in programming.

## Which technologies are you aware of?

<p>
I worked on too many things and I know that is a bad sign of being a jack of all trades. I was into web development for a while where I gained interest in frontend and backend development. I made REST APIs using Node.js and used Bootstrap and <a href="https://getmdl.io">MDL</a> to create beautiful UIs. I made a couple of Android applications too, where I learned the importance of UX while building UIs and I also made my hands dirty in writing bash and Python scripts. 
</p>

## Do you even have a Life AFK?

<p>
I like to visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Drive,_Mumbai">Marine Drive</a> with some of my friends and sometimes I like visiting Zoo and Seashore. I also like to stare at the night sky, looking for stars. Quite dramatic, but true.

## Books that I recommend

- **Code Complete 2** *by Steve Mcconnell* -- One of the best book to improve your software development skills.
- **Don't Make Me Think** *by Steve Krug* -- If you want to build good UIs with good UX, this is one of the best books that you can read.
- **Zero to One** *by Peter Thiel and Blake Masters* -- This book contains quality notes on how to build a successful startup. Do read it if you like startup culture.
- **The Power of your Subconscious Mind** *by Joseph Murphy* -- A book which teaches you on how you can make best out of your subconscious mind. It's truly great.
